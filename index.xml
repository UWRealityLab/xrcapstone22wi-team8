This week is a challenging design and transition week for us where we reconsidered and iterated design choices, and are ready to move to new implementations next week! For example, we have collected many feedbacks and realized that our multiplayer feature is currently not very natural, which is something we need to quickly fix. Moreover, we will also connect our 3D generators with preFabs like desks or whiteboards to make sure that we could generate all those items as some options for users to customize their space and also enable brushes on some special shapes. Some shapes will also be assistant with the file transfer where we will allow users to write on a file. This might also lead to the development of some advanced color picker where users could pick different color and opacity values to draw and highlight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Week 5 Snippet</title><link>https://uwrealitylab.github.io/xrcapstone22wi-team8/snippets/week5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 07:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://uwrealitylab.github.io/xrcapstone22wi-team8/snippets/week5/</guid><description>&lt;p>We released our &lt;a href="https://github.com/UWRealityLab/xrcapstone22wi-team8/releases/tag/mvp-rc.2">MVP&lt;/a> on Tuesday, received feedbacks on Thursday through in-class testing, and continued working towards the target goal according to plan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Week 4 Snippet</title><link>https://uwrealitylab.github.io/xrcapstone22wi-team8/snippets/week4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 15:03:10 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://uwrealitylab.github.io/xrcapstone22wi-team8/snippets/week4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Team members work on their milestone towards the MVP next week.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Week 3 Snippet</title><link>https://uwrealitylab.github.io/xrcapstone22wi-team8/snippets/week3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 23:42:55 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://uwrealitylab.github.io/xrcapstone22wi-team8/snippets/week3/</guid><description>&lt;!-- For this first week snippet you should focus on any testing of project ideas as well as any work done for your proof of concept. -->
