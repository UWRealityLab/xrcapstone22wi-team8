Thanks every team that provided helpful feedback! This week is a challenging design and transition week for us where we reconsidered and iterated design choices, and are ready to move to new implementations next week! For example, we have collected many feedbacks and realized that our multiplayer feature is currently not very natural, which is something we need to quickly fix. Moreover, we will also connect our 3D generators with preFabs like desks or whiteboards to make sure that we could generate all those items as some options for users to customerize their space and also enable brushes on some special shapes. Some shapes will also be assistant with the file transfer where we will allow users to write on a file. This might also lead to the development of some advanced color picker where users could pick different color and opacity values to draw and highlight.

## New Features/Functionalities

- We decided to add wall-blocking for the pen, and hopefully make the interactions more intuitive and clear!
- Multiplayer functions will be refined. Stay tune!

## Review Requests

- N/A

## Blocking Issues

- We are unsure why our Whiteboard script doesn't work with anything other than a plane (e.g. a quad).
- Multi-user is taking longer to implement and we'll have to push back on some stretch goals listed in the PRD.
