<!-- For this first week snippet you should focus on any testing of project ideas as well as any work done for your proof of concept. -->

We have got individual functions work this week!

<!--more-->

## New Features/Functionalities

- Brush prototype that can draw on a board.
- 3D generation from buttons works!
- File transfer is on its way.

## Review Requests

- [#8](https://github.com/UWRealityLab/xrcapstone22wi-team8/pull/8): Generate 3d primitives using Buttons
- [#11](https://github.com/UWRealityLab/xrcapstone22wi-team8/pull/11): File Transfer Client in Flutter


## Blocking Issues

There are no blocking issues this week and we don't need other assistance.

## What's Next

Next week, we'll refine our individual functions and pull everything together, and hopefully the "multiuser".
