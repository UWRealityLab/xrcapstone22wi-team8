<!-- Quick description of your project -->

Boardless is a VR application that provides STEM students with a virtual space to better communicate thoughts and share ideas with 3D models or dangling whiteboards. Users can easily import/export ideas using a variety of brushes and colors, 3D shapes, OCR technology, and other assets.
